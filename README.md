🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
📌 Overview
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to build an optimal classifier.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn for ML modeling
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Handled missing values (Age, Fare)
✔️ Encoded categorical features (Sex, Embarked)
✔️ Feature selection & engineering

📌 Models Built & Evaluated
✅ Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest (Best Performing Model)

🚀 How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git  
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run Jupyter notebooks for EDA & model training. Generate submission.csv for Kaggle.

📈 Results & Insights
Random Forest provided the highest accuracy.
Fare, Age, and Pclass were key survival predictors.
